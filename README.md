# Waveform – Circular Audio Visualizer

Interactive web-based audio visualizer that renders multiple circular waveform rings responding to microphone input.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies (only used for a simple static server):

```bash
cd "/Users/ahad/Dropbox/_Design/Code/GitHub Repos/waveform"
npm install serve
```

2. Start a dev server:

```bash
npm run start
```

3. Open the printed local URL in a modern desktop browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox).

4. Click **“Start microphone”** and allow mic access when prompted.

Speak or play music near your device and watch the circular waveform rings and scatter dots respond to the audio.
